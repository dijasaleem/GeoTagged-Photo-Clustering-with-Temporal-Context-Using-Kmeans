**Geotagged Photo Clustering and Analysis with Temporal Context**


This project aims to analyze and cluster geotagged photo data from London using spatial and temporal attributes. The dataset contains metadata such as the timestamp and location (latitude and longitude) of each photo, allowing for the extraction of temporal context like season and time of day, and performing clustering based on spatial coordinates.
